IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION

Classification is a supervised machine learning technique which is used to predict group membership for data instances. Neural networks are being introduced to simplify the problem of classification. This model focuses on Iris flower classification using Neural Network. For simplification of classification we will use scikit learn tool kit. This project mainly focuses on the classification of dataset using scikit learn. The problem concerns that the recognition of Iris flower species (setosa, versicolor and verginica) on the basis of the measurements of length and width of sepal and petal of the flower. We can generate classification model by using various machine learning algorithms through training the iris flower dataset and can choose the model with highest accuracy to predict the species of iris flower more precisely. Classification of Iris data set would be detecting patterns from examining sepal and petal size of the Iris flower and how the prediction was made from analyzing the pattern to form the class of Iris flower
